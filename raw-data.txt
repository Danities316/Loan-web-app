About Loan Management System Node JS Project
The Loan Management System Project in Node JS express 
framework and a SQL database were used to create this app. 
I utilized html CSS and bootstrap in the frontend. 
This software can assist in keeping track of customers who have taken out a loan. 
Admin can grant a loan to a consumer by enrolling his details. 
Schemes can be added to the system by the administrator.

				Features

1. Customer must provide his name, address, phone number, image, and asset (what he needs to get the loan) as well as the value of his asset.
2. He can take the loan if his asset is good.
3. After that, the system will generate payment dates for the customer and print a pdf for them to keep.
4. Customers must pay their payments on time, and if they do not, they must pay a fine. If he misses a payment by a month, he must pay a fine of 2% of his installment amount.
5. Admin has access to all customer and loan information.
6. Administrator has the ability to edit and delete data.
7. Admin can look up a customerâ€™s ID and view their history.
8. Admin can grant a loan to a consumer by enrolling his details.
9. Schemes can be added to the system by the administrator.
